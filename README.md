FINAL Version...

Some improvements anyone can do:

1. Enhanced like adding a mobile friendly design.
2. Can also add the high score to the api so that when opened again, it can show the highscore
3. User can also add select number of question.
4. Allow user to set the difficulty of the questions

Improvements for hosting:
1. fake api must be run. fake api will run if npm run server, meaning it will not fetch data if it was hosted without api running.
